# ðŸ“Œ Case Study: Agile Transformation for QA Team  

## ðŸ”¹ Scenario  

A QA team faced the following challenges:  
- Testing cycles extended beyond sprint deadline resulting in **delayed release**.
- Poor communication between QA and development teams leading to ****late-stage bug discovery**.  
- Reression testing took **too long**, creating bottlenecks before production releases.  

## ðŸš€ Actions Taken  
âœ… Conducted **Agile training** to align QA & Dev teams with Scrum principles.  
âœ… Implemented **Scrum ceremonies**  -Daily Standups, Sprint Planning, Retrospectives.  
âœ… Defined and enforced **Definition of Ready (DoR) & Definition of Done (DoD)** for test cases.  
âœ… Encouraged **collaboration between QA & Dev teams**, enabling early-stage testing.  
âœ… Automated **80% of regression tests**, reducing execution time.  

## ðŸ“Š Outcome  
- **Testing cycle time reduced by 40%**, aligning QA efforts with sprints.  
- **Sprint predictability improved** due to better backlog refinement.  
- **Cross-team collaboration increased**, leading to **fewer last-minute defects**.
